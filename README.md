# Bike-Purchase-Trends-Analysis-An-Excel-Dashboard

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of working with data in Excel, from initial cleaning and preparation to creating a fully interactive dashboard. The goal is to showcase analytical and visualization skills in Excel while providing a tool for insightful decision-making.

## **Project Overview**
The project focuses on analyzing a dataset of bike purchase patterns and presenting the findings through an interactive dashboard. Key steps include:
- Cleaning and organizing raw data.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Creating pivot tables to summarize key insights.
- Designing an interactive dashboard with slicers and visualizations.

## **Features**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicates and standardized values (e.g., converting abbreviations like "M" to "Married").
   - Created calculated fields such as age brackets for better grouping.
   - Verified data consistency and handled outliers.

2. **Pivot Tables:**
   - Summarized key metrics like average income, bike purchases, and commute distances.
   - Filtered and categorized data to prepare for visualization.

3. **Interactive Dashboard:**
   - Visualized key insights using charts (e.g., bar, line, and column charts).
   - Added slicers to filter by marital status, region, and education levels.
   - Enhanced usability with clear labels, titles, and a clean design.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes demographic and purchasing information for individuals interested in buying bikes. Key fields:
- **Demographics**: Age, marital status, gender, income, region.
- **Attributes**: Occupation, education level, commute distance, car ownership.
- **Target Variable**: Whether the individual purchased a bike.

## **How to Use**
1. **Download the Project File:**
   - The Excel file, including raw data, pivot tables, and the dashboard, is available [here](#).
   
2. **Explore the Dashboard:**
   - Use slicers to filter data by demographics or other criteria.
   - View insights on income trends, commute distances, and age groups.

3. **Modify and Extend:**
   - Add additional metrics or visualizations.
   - Customize the dashboard design to fit your preferences.

---

## **Key Insights**
- Married individuals tend to have higher incomes and are more likely to purchase bikes.
- Commute distances significantly influence bike purchases, with shorter distances being a common factor.
- The 31â€“54 age group is the largest demographic for bike purchases.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Include more advanced Excel features like Power Query for automated data cleaning.
- Integrate additional data sources for deeper analysis.
- Export the dashboard as a template for similar datasets.
